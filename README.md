# MinimaxMCTS
Solving m, n, k-games: Monte Carlo Tree Search vs. Minimax 

You can find a formal write up [here](https://github.com/TheanLim/MinimaxMCTS/blob/main/SolvingMNK_MinimaxMCTS.pdf)

You can replicate the experiment by running [this python file.](https://github.com/TheanLim/MinimaxMCTS/blob/main/experiment35.py). 
Note that it takes around 18 hours of computational time.
